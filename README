DESCRIPTION
-----------

svgtune is just a little helper to generate a set of .svg files out of
a single .svg file, by tuning respective groups/layers visibility,
transparency or anything else.

It might come very handy for generation of incremental figures to be
embedded into the presentation.  For the input, this takes a single
command line parameter -- file with instructions, which might look
like:


# Load the file we should use
%file somefigure.svg

# Make all layers invisible
layers style=display:none
# Store current state into 0_blank file
%save 0_blank

layer label=elements style=display:inline
%save 1

layer id=layer2 style=display:inline
%save 1_3

# Lets make some group visible
g id=g14546 style=display:inline
%save 1_3


For the results, look under somefigure_tuned/ directory.  You might make
advantage of having following in your Makefile:
