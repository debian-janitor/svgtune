Description: tool to generate a set of .svg files out of a single .svg file
 svgtune is a little helper to generate a set of .svg files out
 of a single .svg file, by tuning respective groups/layers visibility,
 transparency or anything else.
 .
 It might come very handy for generation of incremental figures to be
 embedded into the presentation in any format which inkscape could
 render using original .svg file (e.g. pdf, png).
